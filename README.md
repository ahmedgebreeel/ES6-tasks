# ES6-tasks
classes and modules , proxy ,iterator and generator


1) Using ES6 new Syntax & features:
Write a script to create different shapes (rectangle, square, circle)
make all of them inherits from shape class.
a. each shape contains two functions to calculate its area and its
parameter.
b. Display the area and each object parameter in your console by
overriding toString().
c. Make your classes in an external file and import them in a module to
create objects


3) Proxy
create a dynamic object using Proxy such that it has only the following
properties
a∙ name property that accepts only string of 7 characters.
b∙ address property that accepts only string value.
c∙ age property that accepts numerical value between 25 and 60.


5) generator
Create a generator that returns fibonacci series that takes only
one parameter. Make two different implementations as described
below:
a. the parameter passed determines the number of elements
displayed from the series.
b. the parameter passed determines the max number of the
displayed series should not exceed its value.

6) iterator
Create an iterable object by implementing @@iterator method
i.e. Symbol.iterator, so that you can use for..of and retrieve its
properties. retrieving the object properties and its values.
